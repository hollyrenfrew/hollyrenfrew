        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            As a graduate of the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully in a professional software development environment. Through a combination of coursework, hands-on projects, and continuous improvement, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science principles and modern development practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most valuable experiences during this program was creating and refining my ePortfolio. Revisiting past work, applying enhancements, and aligning each project with industry standards gave me the opportunity to showcase not just technical skills, but also growth, problem-solving, and attention to detail. This process reinforced my strengths in structured programming, secure software design, and full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am comfortable working both independently and collaboratively. Throughout the program, I gained experience using Git for version control, participating in code reviews, and communicating technical concepts clearly. I understand the importance of translating stakeholder needs into technical requirements, whether I’m writing documentation or presenting a project to a non-technical audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            My skills with data structures and algorithms are grounded in practical use. I’ve applied them in C++, Python, and Java projects to improve performance and efficiency. I understand the trade-offs between different approaches and have used this knowledge to guide design decisions across multiple projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In software engineering and database development, I’ve built modular systems, integrated relational databases, and implemented persistent storage. I am confident in my ability to design secure, scalable systems that prioritize performance and user experience. I also approach each project with a security mindset, applying best practices in authentication, input validation, and data protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            This portfolio highlights three projects that demonstrate a wide range of skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Weight Tracker Android application (CS-360) reflects my experience with mobile development, user authentication, and secure data handling.</li>
            <li>The Airgead Banking Calculator (CS-210) showcases algorithmic logic, data handling, and C++ class structure.</li>
            <li>The Python RPG (IT-140, enhanced for CS-499) illustrates my ability to refactor legacy code, design a relational database schema, and implement persistent state management.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Together, these projects represent a complete picture of my technical abilities and growth throughout the program. They demonstrate not only how I approach problem-solving and code quality, but also how I consider usability, security, and long-term maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Completing this program has prepared me to step confidently into a software development role. I am ready to contribute to modern software teams, adapt to evolving technologies, and continue building solutions that are both effective and secure. This portfolio serves as evidence of my readiness and the work I am capable of producing.
        </p>
